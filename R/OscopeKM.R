# Preamble
# ********
# 
# This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
# Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.  The
# intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over
# the development of that Package while still keeping the Package
# available as open source and free software.
# 
# You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
# license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
# terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
# make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a
# different licensing arrangement.

# "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
# modify the Package.
# 
# "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
# Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files.  A
# given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified
# Version.
# 
# "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
# accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization,
# to others outside of your company or organization.
# 
# "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
# Package or providing support for this Package to another party.  It does
# not mean licensing fees.
# 
# "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
# has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
# Holder.
# 
# "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
# changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
# 
# "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
# Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
# modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
# 
# "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
# configuration files for the Package.
# 
# "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
# other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of

# 
# Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
# ********************************************************
# 
# (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
# Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you
# do not Distribute the Modified Version.
# 
# Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
# ******************************************************
# 
# (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
# Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
# either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all
# of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your
# discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form
# of the Package.
# 
# (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
# modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
# Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will
# be subject to the Original License.
# 
# Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
# **********************************************************
# 
# (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
# for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
# Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from
# the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
# non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do
# at least ONE of the following:
# 
# (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
# Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
# Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
# 
# (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent
# the user installing or running the Standard Version.  In addition, the
# Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the
# Standard Version.
# 
# (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
# Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
# 
# (i) the Original License or
# 
# (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
# redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
# apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
# Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
# be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
# Distributor Fees are allowed.
# 
# Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
# ******************************************************************
# Versions without the Source
# ***************************
# 
# (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
# the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
# get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid
# at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time
# while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must
# provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If
# you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days
# after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do
# not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
# 
# (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
# Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
# Source of the Modified Version.
# 
# Aggregating or Linking the Package
# **********************************
# 
# (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
# Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
# aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
# Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
# components in the aggregation are permitted.  The terms of this license
# apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
# as included in the aggregation.
# 
# (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
# works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
# stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
# Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the
# result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
# 
# Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
# ********************************************************
# 
# (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
# merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
# the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
# considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms
# of this license.
# 
# General Provisions
# ******************
# 
# (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
# Versions is governed by this Artistic License.  By using, modifying or
# distributing the Package, you accept this license.  Do not use, modify,
# or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
# 
# (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
# made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
# that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this
# license.
# 
# (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
# service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

#' @title Oscope K medoid module
#' @usage OscopeKM(SineRes, quan=.95,cut=NULL,maxK=NULL,minSize=0, maxSize=200, fixK=NULL, rawscale=TRUE)
#' @param SineRes output of OscopeSine function. 
#' @param quan only gene pairs with similarity score >= quan th quantile will be 
#' considered in the clustering analyses. Default is 0.95.
#' @param cut pre-defined cutoff. Gene pairs with similarity score >= cut will be considered in
#' cluster analyses. If cut is defined, quan will be ignored.
#' @param maxK max number of clusters to consider (scan). if numbC=NULL, it will be calculated as 
#' [number of gene considered]/10
#' @param minSize,maxSize Only clusters with minSize<= cluster size <= maxSize are 
#' reported in output.
#' @param fixK if fixK is specified, the k-medoids algorithm will be applied with fixK clusters.
#' @param rawscale 
#' Recall the input 
#' is the similarity matrix (-log10(distance from the sine model)). 
#' the k-medoids clustering will be applied using (-Input) as distance. If rawscale is defined as TRUE,
#' the k-medoids clustering will be applied using -10^Input as distance.
#' @return OscopeKM() calls scanK() function, which runs k-medoid clustering with varying number of clusters (k). 
#' The k is varied from 2 to maxK. The input should be the output of OscopeSine() function.
#' scanK() function will cluster genes in gene pairs with high similarity score (the threshold can be
#' defined using parameter quan). To select the top genes, the function first calculate the max similarity
#' score for each gene, then select the genes with high max score.
#'
#' The output object shows
#' members in each cluster. clusters are sorted by median similarity score within cluster.
