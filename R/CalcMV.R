# 
# (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
# Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
# 
# (i) the Original License or
# 
# (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
# redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
# apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
# Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
# be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
# Distributor Fees are allowed.
# 
# Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
# ******************************************************************
# Versions without the Source
# ***************************
# 
# (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
# the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
# get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid
# at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time
# while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must
# provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If
# you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days
# after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do
# not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
# 
# (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
# Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
# Source of the Modified Version.
# 
# Aggregating or Linking the Package
# **********************************
# 
# (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
# Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
# aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
# Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
# components in the aggregation are permitted.  The terms of this license
# apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
# as included in the aggregation.
# 
# (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
# works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
# stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
# Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the
# result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
# 
# Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
# ********************************************************
# 
# (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
# merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
# the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
# considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms
# of this license.
# 
# General Provisions
# ******************
# 
# (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
# Versions is governed by this Artistic License.  By using, modifying or
# distributing the Package, you accept this license.  Do not use, modify,
# or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
# 
# (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
# made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
# that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this
# license.
# 
# (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
# service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

#' @title Calculate estimated mean and variance of RNA-Seq data
#' @usage CalcMV(Data, Sizes=NULL, NormData=FALSE, MeanCutLow=100, MeanCutHigh=NULL, ApproxVal=10^-6, Plot=TRUE)
#' @param Data input data matrix; it should be a gene-by-sample or isoform-by sample matrix
#' @param Sizes The library size factor for each sample. the number of values in Sizes is expected to be the
#' same as the number of columns of Data. The library size factor will be estimated using the median
#' normalization method implemented in EBSeq if Sizes is specified as NULL.
#' @param MeanCutLow,MeanCutHigh we suggests the users to apply Oscope on genes with high mean and 
#' high variance. By default, MeanCutLow is specified as 100, consequently only genes with mean > 100
#' will be used. The CalcMV function will fit a linear regression on log(variance)~log(mean) on these 
#' genes. Genes with variance above this line are considered as the high mean high variance genes.
#' The upper bound of mean may be specified using MeanCutHigh. If both are specified as NULL, all of the genes
#' will be considered when fitting the regression.
#' @param NormData whether the data is already normalized. If NormData=TRUE, the specification of Sizes
#' will be ignored and no normalization will be applied.
#' @param ApproxVal Default is 10^-6. It is used to approximate the estimate of parameter q for genes/isoforms
#' whose estimated variance is less than estimated mean. q will be estimated using 1-ApproxVal
#' @param Plot if Plot = T, a mean-variance plot will be shown. The fitted line will be shown and the
#' selected genes will be marked in green.
#' @return Output is a list with 6 sublists : Mean: estimated means of genes/isoforms; Var: estimated variances;
#' Median: estimated medians; GeneToUse: the high mean high variance genes (suggested input for Oscope);
#' Q: estimated q's (without apporximation); Q_mdf: estimated q's with approximations;
#' Phi_mdf: estimated overdispersion parameter (phi), with approximations.
